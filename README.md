# Evolutionary-Algorithm

Investigation into Evolutionary Algorithm performance, comparing differing crossover and mutation operators, and how well they work together.

This development looks at the Bicycle Courier Problem, and is solved with the evolutionary algorithm, which produces a solution that allows accurate and scalable results. 
The software uses an ordered crossover operator, both 1 and 2 point.
A mutation operator is also used that swaps 2 random allels, and another that swaps the first and second allels. Different permutations of these can be measured in terms of fitness and time

The results are outputted into CSV format.
